## What makes our project stand out? 

The world needs more curious, creative, and confident kids. We help solve this. 
Kids are growing up in an increasingly digital world, but most schools don't have the resources to teach them how to code or program their own robots ðŸ¤– . This means that they're missing out on some of the best opportunities for learning and creativity today.

Robot In A Can is a new after school coding and robotics club where we help kids learn how to code and build their own robots with little or no experience! We offer both summer camp sessions as well as year-round classes during school breaks. Our goal is to give your ðŸ‘§ &ðŸ‘¦ hands-on skills that will empower them throughout life!
